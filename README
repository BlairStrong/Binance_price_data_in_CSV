1. TITLE
Binance Price history downloader

2. Project Description
This is a simple script to download all of the binance price history for a given coin, from a given start date and at a given interval.
the coins must be listed in BASEQUOTE form ie. BTCETH or BNBUSDT. There are limiters in palce to avoid over requesting from the binance API.

This script checks to see if a current file exsist for data and will only update with new data. This avoids duplication for ease of processessing and reduces time for download and demand from the binance API.


4. How to Install and Run the Project

I dont beleive there are any additional modules required, so no requriements.txt have been placed in this dir.
 in order to use:
 	Please modify main.py with the list of coins you need and the interval you require.
 	Comma separeavted value files will be generated in the same directory the script is running in for each coin. these should be named intuitivley as f"{symbol}_prices_{interval}.csv" where symbol is the BASEQUOTE pair and internval is as defined above
